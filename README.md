Android Design - A Demo Application for Movies
===================
I found an amazing application that is simply applicable in Android. The design and style is created with different tools. I manage to find a good platform using the [proxy](https://avoidcensorship.com/) for application. 

The interaction at Droidcon 2013 brought me an idea how to move and cut the style into various updates. You can choose a different theme and style if you want, just download the given application and find a good movie you wanted to watch for the day.
